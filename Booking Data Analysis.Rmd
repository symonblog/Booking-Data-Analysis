```

Report Analysis of fitting phase-type distributions to an example data set.

## Data set

Booking data example with some variables

```{r Import, echo=FALSE}
BookingData<-read.csv("C:/Users/nwuser/Downloads/BookingData.csv", sep=";")
```

```{r view}
head(BookingData)
```
It contains observations for different flights from Berlin

```{r O-D1, echo=TRUE}
unique(BookingData[['ORIGIN']])
```
to `r length(unique(BookingData[['DEST']]))` destinations

```{r O-D2, echo=TRUE}
unique(BookingData[['DEST']], fromLast = TRUE)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
